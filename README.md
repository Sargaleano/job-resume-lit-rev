The study analyses the literature that addresses the application of text mining to job recruitment, with a focus on the task of job-résumé matching. Unlike a traditional literature review, the bibliometric approach allows for a multifaceted assessment of the evolution of research frontiers on this subject, including the following aspects:

 1. Performance indicators of publication dynamics from a historical perspective, including trends of frequent terms, productivity and citation scores.
 
 2. Authorship patterns, leading contributors, institute distribution and geographic covering of the published research.
 
 3. Topic maps and thematic evolution of the main concepts covered in the literature, including identification of periods of different research development.

 4. Collaboration and intellectual networks emerging from the literature.
 
 5. Selection of relevant works highlighting the most relevant contributions to the subject of job-résumé matching during our observation period  applications.

The raw data used in the study was formatted as a BIB file, where each bibliographic record includes the following metadata fields: title, author, abstract, keywords, journal, volume, pages, year, publisher, language, document type, citations, affiliation, references, and source (Scopus or Scholar).
