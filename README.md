## A Bibliometric Perspective on AI Research for Job-Résumé Matching
by Sergio Rojas-Galeano, Jorge Posada and Esteban Ordoñez
(c) 2022

This study analyses the literature that addresses the application of text mining to job recruitment, with a focus on the task of job-résumé matching. Unlike a traditional literature review, the bibliometric approach allows us to offer a multifaceted assessment of the evolution of research frontiers on this subject. Specifically, we describe the following aspects:

1. Descriptive statistics of publication record from a historical perspective, including trends of frequents terms, productivity and citation scores.
 
2. Authorship patterns, leading contributors, institute distribution and geographic covering of the published research.
 
3. Topic maps and thematic evolution of the main concepts covered in the research studies.

4. Collaboration and intellectual networks emerging from the literature.
 
5. Selection of relevant works that address state-of-the-art topics in computer-assisted job-résumé matching applications.

The raw data used in the study was formatted as a BIB file, where each bibliographic record includes the following metadata fields: title, author, abstract, keywords, journal, volume, pages, year, publisher, language, document type, citations, affiliation, references, and source (Scopus or Scholar).
