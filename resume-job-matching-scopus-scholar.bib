abstract={In order to ensure the performance of delivery, especially in the IT digital services company, we need to affect the right candidate in the right position; in this context, the recruitment process needs to be automatic, subjective, and more accurate. Employers need help to find the right candidate from an of resumes, and many studies have proposed several solutions for recommending a candidate for recruitment and matching between the job offer and cv candidates that exploit text processing and semantics-based techniques. In our research, we aim to present a comparative study between the different approaches used for the matching job and cv candidate; we also proposed a new approach to recommend a potential candidate for a specific work area, our study will be based on an IT service company based in Morocco and aim the automatization of the recruitment process to ensure the assignment of the candidate in the right task and ensure the success of the company, then the customer’s satisfaction. © 2021 Seventh Sense Research Group®.},

abstract={During the last years, the development in diverse areas related to computer science and internet, allowed to generate new alternatives for decision making in the selection of personnel for state and private companies. In order to optimize this selection process, the recommendation systems are the most suitable for working with explicit information related to the likes and dislikes of employers or end users, since this information allows to generate lists of recommendations based on collaboration or similarity of content. Therefore, this research takes as a basis these characteristics contained in the database of curricula and job offers, which correspond to the Peruvian ambit, which highlights the experience, knowledge and skills of each candidate, which are described in textual terms or words. This research focuses on the problem: how we can take advantage from the growth of unstructured information about job offers and curriculum vitae on different websites for CV recommendation. So, we use the techniques from Text Mining and Natural Language Processing. Then, as a relevant technique for the present study, we emphasize the technique frequency of the Term - Inverse Frequency of the documents (TF-IDF), which allows identifying the most relevant CVs in relation to a job offer of website through the average values (TF-IDF). So, the weighted value can be used as a qualification value of the relevant curriculum vitae for the recommendation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Online recruitment systems or automatic resume processing systems are becoming more popular because it saves time for both employers and job seekers. Manually processing these resumes and fitting to several job specifications is a difficult task. Due to the increased amount of data, it is a big challenge to effectively analyze each resume based on various parameters like experience, skill set, etc. Processing, extracting information and reviewing these applications automatically would save time and money. Automatic data extraction, focused primarily on skillset, experience and education from a resume. So, it extremely helpful to map the appropriate resume for the right job description. In this research study, we propose a system that uses multi-level classification techniques to automatically extract detailed segment information like skillset, experience and education from resume based on specific parameters. We have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in the segment of the resumes to identify skill sets. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Resume-job matching is one of the most important steps in recruitment chain. in big companies like Tencent, we routinely spend thousands of hours searching for potential candidates through internal and external recruiting platforms every day, which is tedious and passive. Besides, the traditional job descriptions are difficult to cover various hiring scenarios with surging diversified and personalized needs. To this end, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network for active resume recommendation without dependence on job requirements. the key idea is to model latent preferences of recruiters by learning interactions of multi-field features with convolutional neural network. Based on real behavior data generated by the internal recruiting website, the experimental results show that our model improves resume click-through rate against a series of state-of-the-art methods. in this way, we find an effective approach to lower the time budgets for our recruiters. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={As we know, one of the essential social problems is unemployment. Hence, many job advertising agencies tend to consolidate various job offerings to assist the job seekers. As these job descriptions carry unstructured text, therefore, it makes the process of finding and grouping relevant jobs difficult. Hence, the aim of this paper is to automatically extract information from job descriptions. This involves application of text mining and information extraction approaches. To carry out this study, first various features are extracted and later Gradient Boosting classification algorithm is used to perform information extraction. Fields such as salary, required degree, required experience etc. are being extracted automatically. Results show that various features affect the overall result. This proposed model is currently evaluated with the help of precision, recall, receiver operating characteristics curve, and area under the curve (AUC). Experiments show that boosting classification tends to provide reasonable result with 77% of precision. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={In the current smart world, everything should be done faster, smarter, and accurate way. The various organization's recruitment processes will be done face to face in an arranged venue. But, during some pandemics like Covid-19 face to face recruitment process will be very difficult. In the proposed system, a smarter way of performing the recruitment processes anywhere around the world based on the company requirements is performed. The aim of this article deals with making the process of candidate recruitment easier for companies. The amount of manual work that goes into recruiting processes is reduced and the initial scanning process of candidates was performed. By eliminating the redundant candidates helps in retaining only the applicable ones. Achieve this through the help of resume scanning, initial aptitude testing of candidates, and an interview session where the candidate answers questions asked by the interviewer. With this model, all the time and manual labor that is wasted in eliminating the redundant candidates is accomplished. It chooses the one who is best applicable to a job by comparing it with the job description based on the resumes received. Our model is working accurately for some of the predefined parameters of the company in a recruitment process by providing more security and reliability. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={With the ever-increasing growth of online recruitment data, job-resume matching has become an important task to automatically match jobs with suitable resumes. This task is typically casted as a supervised text matching problem. Supervised learning is powerful when the labeled data is sufficient. However, on online recruitment platforms, job-resume interaction data is sparse and noisy, which affects the performance of job-resume match algorithms. To alleviate these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-view co-teaching network from sparse interaction data for job-resume matching. Our network consists of two major components, namely text-based matching model and relation-based matching model. The two parts capture semantic compatibility in two different views, and complement each other. In order to ad- dress the challenges from sparse and noisy data, we design two specific strategies to combine the two components. First, two com- ponents share the learned parameters or representations, so that the original representations of each component can be enhanced. More importantly, we adopt a co-teaching mechanism to reduce the influence of noise in training data. The core idea is to let the two components help each other by selecting more reliable training instances. The two strategies focus on representation enhancement and data enhancement, respectively. Compared with pure text-based matching models, the proposed approach is able to learn better data representations from limited or even sparse interaction data, which is more resistible to noise in training data. Experiment results have demonstrated that our model is able to outperform state-of-the-art methods for job-resume matching. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={Person-job fit is to match candidates and job posts on online recruitment platforms using machine learning algorithms. The effectiveness of matching algorithms heavily depends on the learned representations for the candidates and job posts. In this paper, we propose to learn comprehensive and effective representations of the candidates and job posts via feature fusion. First, in addition to applying deep learning models for processing the free text in resumes and job posts, which is adopted by existing methods, we extract semantic entities from the whole resume (and job post) and then learn features for them. By fusing the features from the free text and the entities, we get a comprehensive representation for the information explicitly stated in the resume and job post. Second, however, some information of a candidate or a job may not be explicitly captured in the resume or job post. Nonetheless, the historical applications including accepted and rejected cases can reveal some implicit intentions of the candidates or recruiters. Therefore, we propose to learn the representations of implicit intentions by processing the historical applications using LSTM. Last, by fusing the representations for the explicit and implicit intentions, we get a more comprehensive and effective representation for person-job fit. Experiments over 10 months real data show that our solution outperforms existing methods with a large margin. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component of the fused representation. The extracted semantic entities help interpret the matching results in the case study. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={At LinkedIn, we want to create economic opportunity for everyone in the global workforce. To make this happen, LinkedIn offers a reactive Job Search system, and a proactive Jobs You May Be Interested In (JYMBII) system to match the best candidates with their dream jobs. One of the most challenging tasks for developing these systems is to properly extract important skill entities from job postings and then target members with matched attributes. In this work, we show that the commonly used text-based salience and market-agnostic skill extraction approach is sub-optimal because it only considers skill mention and ignores the salient level of a skill and its market dynamics, i.e., the market supply and demand influence on the importance of skills. To address the above drawbacks, we present Job2Skills, our deployed salience and market-aware skill extraction system. The proposed Job2Skills shows promising results in improving the online performance of job recommendation (JYMBII) (+1.92% job apply) and skill suggestions for job posters (-37% suggestion rejection rate). Lastly, we present case studies to show interesting insights that contrast traditional skill recognition method and the proposed Job2Skills from occupation, industry, country, and individual skill levels. Based on the above promising results, we deployed the Job2Skills online to extract job targeting skills for all 20M job postings served at LinkedIn. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={The challenge of the growth of the aging society is causing a critical economic burden that is affecting the gross domestic product of many countries. Normally, recruiters for information technology employment face the problem of matching appropriate candidates with available positions as they may have insufficient knowledge to determine whether candidate profiles are suitable. The requirements and demand for jobs may not be enough to advance the situation while matching skills and competence with job descriptions often preclude older candidates. This research is supported by the Thai Gerontology Research and Development Institute (TGRI). Herein, we present a solution involving data mart modeling and machine learning. In the data mart modeling, an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process that pulls data into a data mart (star schema) and then applies distance measures to calculate matching. Historical records of both the companies and older job seekers are kept in the data mart to understand behavior and keep track of data. Moreover, we collect disease information and map to ICD-10 code. This can help employers to find appropriate job seekers related to their skill sets and limitation of disease. We treat their skills as terms and employment positions as documents and then calculate the ranking of each job profile. The results show that the outcomes garnered from the distance measures are consistent and creditable. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={This article provides empirical evidence on the relation between institutional characteristics of labour markets that frame allocation processes, and optimal skill matching at the individual level. We investigate the extent to which skill-based job-worker matches are associated with employment protection legislation (EPL), unemployment benefits, and enforcing and enabling activating labour market policies. Drawing on data of the OECD’s Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), and performing cross-country analyses of 28 industrial countries, we find that EPL can explain variance in the share of optimal skill matching across countries, displaying a positive relation. We also find a negative relation between strict enforcing activating labour market policies and optimal skill matching. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={This paper presents a job recommender system to match resumes to job descriptions (JD), both of which are nonstandard and unstructured/semi-structured in form. First, the paper proposes a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for the task of skill extraction. The performance of the combined techniques on an industrial scale dataset yielded a precision and recall of 0.78 and 0.88 respectively. The paper then introduces the concept of extracting implicit skills - the skills which are not explicitly mentioned in a JD but may be implicit in the context of geography, industry or role. To mine and infer implicit skills for a JD, we find the other JDs similar to this JD. This similarity match is done in the semantic space. A Doc2Vec model is trained on 1.1 Million JDs covering several domains crawled from the web, and all the JDs are projected onto this semantic space. The skills absent in the JD but present in similar JDs are obtained, and the obtained skills are weighted using several techniques to obtain the set of final implicit skills. Finally, several similarity measures are explored to match the skills extracted from a candidate's resume to explicit and implicit skills of JDs. Empirical results for matching resumes and JDs demonstrate that the proposed approach gives a mean reciprocal rank of 0.88, an improvement of 29.4% when compared to the performance of a baseline method that uses only explicit skills. © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.},

abstract={Skills extraction is a critical task when creating job recommender systems. It is also useful for building skills profiles and skills knowledge bases for organizations. The aim of skills extraction is to identify the skills expressed in documents such as resumes or job postings. Several methods have been proposed to tackle this problem. These methods already perform well when it comes to extracting explicitly mentioned skills from resumes. But skills have different levels of abstraction: high-level skills can be determined by low-level ones. Instead of just extracting skill-related terms, we propose a multi-label classification architecture model based on convolutional neural networks to predict high-level skills from resumes even if they are not explicitly mentioned in these resumes. Experiments carried out on a set of anonymous IT resumes collected from the Internet have shown the effectiveness of our method reaching 98.79% of recall and 91.34% of precision. In addition, features (terms) detected by convolutional filters are projected on the input resumes in order to present to the user, the terms which contributed to the model decision. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Finding résumés that match a job description can be a daunting task for a recruitment agency, due to the fact that these agencies are dealing with hundreds of job descriptions and tens of thousands of résumés simultaneously. In this paper we explain a search method devised for a recruitment agency by measuring similarity between résumé documents and job description documents. Document vectors are obtained via TF-IDF weights from word embeddings arising from a neural language model with a skip-gram loss function. We show that, with this approach, successful searches can be achieved, and that the number of skips assumed in the skip gram loss function determines how successful it can be for different job descriptions.

abstract={Interest in talent recognition, talent recruitment, education and labor mobility has been on the rise in last years. Business sector is changing its human resources (HR) policies globally, changing ways in policies and practices related to employee management and employer branding. The process of talent recognition and/or search was mostly manual work, often carried by professional agencies or HR officer in organization. In today’s challenging labor market environment, this process is inefficient and slow with and often limited in success. In this paper we are focused on skills, education and lifelong learning domain which has an important role in the 10 priorities of the European Commission (EC) 2014–2019. Our starting point was to look for machine learning and big data techniques to support the policy makers and analysts in reducing mismatch between jobs and skills at regional level in the European Union (EU) through the use of data. Our research includes massive semi structured resume dataset (50+ million documents) combined with several official statistical surveys. We were able to leverage the advances in machine learning and big data to automate resume/skill classification and to improve productivity in skill-based labor market mechanics and dynamics analysis. This paper proposes a model of extracting important information after resumes are being partially classified, classify skills using European multilingual classification of Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) by skill pillar matching and use modern interactive visualization tools to gain smart insights powered by geospatial and time-series analysis. Research goals are to point attention towards data science and machine learning and its usage in labor and educational market mechanics and dynamics. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={An approach to semantic text similarity matching is concept-based characterization of entities and themes that can be automatically extracted from content. This is useful to build an effective recommender system on top of similarity measures and its usage for document retrieval and ranking. In this work, our research goal is to create an expert system for education recommendation, based on skills, capabilities, areas of expertise present in someone’s curriculum vitae and personal preferences. This form of semantic text matching challenge needs to take into account all the personal educational experiences (formal, informal, and on-the-job), but also work-related know-how, to create a concept based profile of the person. This will allow a reasoned matching process from CVs and career vision to descriptions of education programs. Taking inspiration from the explicit semantic analysis (ESA), we developed a domain-specific approach to semantically characterize short texts and to compare their content for semantic similarity. Thanks to an enriching and a filtering process, we transform the general purpose German Wikipedia into a domain specific model for our task. The domain is defined also through a German knowledge base or vocabulary of description for educational experiences and for job offers. Initial testing with a small set of documents demonstrated that our approach covers the main requirements and can match semantically similar text content. This is applied in a use case and lead to the implementation of an education recommender system prototype. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The fast growth of the Internet caused a matching growth of the amount of available online information that increased the need to expand the ability of users to manage all this information. This encourages a substantial interest in specific research fields and technologies that could benefit the managing of this information overload. However, in the Philippines, it has been a challenge for most job agencies to find out and predict job matching intelligently due to lack of accurate models to be adopted. To address this problem, the researchers developed job matching application specifically for Pangasinan Employment Service Office (PESO). The aim is to know how these measures behave and whether they validate the idea that applicants? data have more in common with job profile. The process of matching an applicant with an offered job is performed through the use of vectorization model and cosine similarity. Large training sets of records of applicants and job profiles were used to define the weights of the parameters. The results show that the selection of cosine similarity measures and vector weights are significant in job matching application, especially in those where the applicants? information?s likeness is measured. © WCSE 2019.

abstract={The rapid development of the Internet has led to introducing new methods for e-recruitment and human resources management. These methods aim to systematically address the limitations of conventional recruitment procedures through incorporating natural language processing tools and semantics-based methods. In this context, for a given job post, applicant resumes (usually uploaded as free-text unstructured documents in different formats such as.pdf,.doc or.rtf) are matched/screened out using the conventional keyword-based model enriched by additional resources such as occupational categories and semantics-based techniques. Employing these techniques has proved to be effective in reducing the cost, time, and efforts required in traditional recruitment and candidate selection methods. However, bridging the skill gap - that is, the propensity to precisely detect and extract relevant skills in applicant resumes and job posts - and highlighting the hidden semantic dimensions encoded in applicant resumes are still challenging issues in the process of devising effective e-recruitment systems. This is due to the fact that resources exploited by current e-recruitment systems are obtained from generic domain-independent sources, therefore resulting in knowledge incompleteness and the lack of domain coverage. In this article, we review state-of-the-art e-recruitment approaches and highlight recent advancements in this domain. An e-recruitment framework addressing current shortcomings through the use of multiple cooperative semantic resources, feature extraction techniques and skill relatedness measures is detailed. An instantiation of the proposed framework is proposed and an experimental validation using a real-world recruitment dataset from two employment portals demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Firstly, we extracted resume feature and used K-means++ algorithm to cluster positions. The use of clustering results is beneficial for speedy recommendation. Afterward, we also constructed text vector and combined TF-IDF and part-of-speech weights to recommend resumes. At last, it is proved that the recommendation result of the proposed algorithm is better than the word frequency vector after a lot of manual evaluations. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Finding the right employee in the employee recruitment process in an organization is a challenging tasks. For example, enormous candidates participated in the selection, various parameters to be examined from the candidates. Furthermore, the selection process done manually could take long time during the selection process. In addition, there is a case that sometimes the position of the employee's work is not suitable with the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates. Moreover, in some cases using Curriculum Vitae (CV), Interview, and Assessment Test could not give the optimal selection results. There is a need to overcome this problems to create more comprehensive and could suggest the employee placement based on their characteristics. In this study, Profile Matching is used to comprehensively assess the candidates. In addition, Naïve Bayes is used in the next step to determine or predict the employee placement based on their characteristics. Validation is conducted by performing bivariate correlation to evaluate the Profile Matching and accuracy is used to evaluate the suitability of the employee placement. The results shows that there is a positive correlation with the value of 0.93. Meanwhile, the prediction using Naïve Bayes model shows a 100% accuracy to predict employee placement. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Online recruitment services are now rapidly changing the landscape of hiring traditions on the job market. There are hundreds of millions of registered users with resumes, and tens of millions of job postings available on the Web. Learning good job-resume matching for recruitment services is important. Existing studies on job-resume matching generally focus on learning good representations of job descriptions and resume texts with comprehensive matching structures. We assume that it would bring benefits to learn the preference of both recruiters and job-seekers from previous interview histories and expect such preference is helpful to improve job-resume matching. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel matching network with preference modeled. The key idea is to explore the latent preference given the history of all interviewed candidates for a job posting and the history of all job applications for a particular talent. To be more specific, we propose a profiling memory module to learn the latent preference representation by interacting with both the job and resume sides. We then incorporate the preference into the matching framework as an end-to-end learnable neural network. Based on the real-world data from an online recruitment platform namely “Boss Zhipin”, the experimental results show that the proposed model could improve the job-resume matching performance against a series of state-of-the-art methods. In this way, we demonstrate that recruiters and talents indeed have preference and such preference can improve job-resume matching on the job market. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={We use the Average Word Embeddings (AWE) model for retrieving relevant CVs based on a job description. We designed experiments to demonstrate that the trained vectors, obtained from a balanced domain corpus, are better than using pre-trained word embeddings. We also present some experiments to show that different combinations of both word embeddings spaces increase the overall accuracy of the retrieval task compared to using only the pre-trained vectors. However an issue arised when both embeddings spaces are not sharing the same dimensions and terms, as shown in our case. In order to handle this situation, we suggest to use a method to reduce dimensions of pre-trained vectors (e.g. PCA), and combine them with our trained vectors. This improves the accuracy of the retrieval task for unseen CVs. Our main contribution is to create a model that detects which embeddings need to be used in order to maximize the relevant retrieval results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Among the fast progress of business domain all enterprises are undergoing a dramatic shift to help themselves improve their performance. Decision making in any organization should firstly rely on choosing the perfect candidates for any job opportunity they have, therefore linking an employer to the perfect graduate is a hard mission when having to search between thousands of resumes. In general, some key points or particular information found in a specific resume may help accomplishing this mission. For this reason, finding a reliable way to search for some data through the resumes is a perfect solution that saves time, effort and complexity. This paper proposes a method that helps employers, orientation units in any academic institution, training centers or job fairs to search for a specific job description in a system flooded with resumes in order to find the correct query answer, even if the resume of the candidate is written with some fuzzy mistakes. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={With the success of the electronic recruitment, now it is easier to find a job offer and apply for it. However, due to this same success, nowadays, human resource managers tend to receive high volumes of applications for each job offer. These applications turn into large quantities of documents, known as résumés or curricula vitae, that need to be processed quickly and correctly. To reduce the time necessary to process the résumés, human resource managers have been working with the scientific community to create systems that automate their ranking. Until today, most of these systems are based on the comparison of job offers and résumés. Nevertheless, this comparison is impossible to do in data sets where job offers are no longer available, as it happens in this work. We present two methods to rank résumés that do not use job offers or any semantic resource, unlike existing state-of-the-art systems. The methods are based on what we call Inter-Résumé Proximity, which is the lexical similarity between only résumés sent by candidates in response to the same job offer. Besides, we propose the use of Relevance Feedback, at general and lexical levels to improve the ranking of résumés. Relevance Feedback is applied using techniques based on similarity coefficients and vocabulary scoring. All the methods have been tested on a large corpus of 171 real selection processes, which correspond to more than 14,000 résumés. The developed methods can rank correctly, in average, 93% of the résumés sent to each job posting. The outcomes presented here show that it is not necessary to use job offers or semantic resources to provide high quality results. Furthermore, we observed that résumés have particular characteristics that as ensemble, work as a facial composite and provide more information about the job posting than the job offer. This certainly will change how systems analyze and rank résumés. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper focuses majorly on the design of the web application which will be used to screen resumes (Curriculum Vitae) for a particular job posting. In the proposed system, a web application will encourage the job applicant candidates as well as the recruiters to use it for job applications and screening of resumes. Recruitment is a tedious process wherein the first task for any recruiter is to screen the resumes. The proposed web application is designed in such a way that job applicant as well as recruiters can use it with ease for applying for job openings and screening respectively. The recruiters from various companies can post the details of the job openings available in their respective companies. The interactive web application will allow the job applicants to submit their resume and apply for their job postings they may still be interested in. The resumes submitted by the candidates are then compared with the job profile requirement posted by the company recruiter by using techniques like machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Scores can then be given to the resumes and they can be ranked from highest match to lowest match. This ranking is made visible only to the company recruiter who is interested to select the best candidates from a large pool of candidates. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Job recommendation is an important task for the modern recruitment industry. An excellent job recommender system not only enables to recommend a higher paying job which is maximally aligned with the skill-set of the current job, but also suggests to acquire few additional skills which are required to assume the new position. In this work, we created three types of information networks from the historical job data: (i) job transition network, (ii) job-skill network, and (iii) skill co-occurrence network. We provide a representation learning model which can utilize the information from all three networks to jointly learn the representation of the jobs and skills in the shared k-dimensional latent space. In our experiments, we show that by jointly learning the representation for the jobs and skills, our model provides better recommendation for both jobs and skills. Additionally, we also show some case studies which validate our claims. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Due to the increasing growth in online recruitment, traditional hiring methods are becoming inefficient. This is due to the fact that job portals receive enormous numbers of unstructured resumes-in diverse styles and formats-from applicants with different fields of expertise and specialization. Therefore, the extraction of structured information from applicant resumes is needed not only to support the automatic screening of candidates, but also to efficiently route them to their corresponding occupational categories. This assists in minimizing the effort required by employers to manage and organize resumes, as well as to screen out irrelevant candidates. In this paper, we present JRC-a Job Post and Resume Classification system that exploits an integrated knowledge base for carrying out the classification task. Unlike conventional systems that attempt to search globally in the entire space of resumes and job posts, JRC matches resumes that only fall under their relevant occupational categories. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we have conducted several experiments using a real-world recruitment dataset. Additionally, we have evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed system against state-of-The-Art online recruitment systems. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we investigate the important and challenging task of recommending appropriate jobs for job seeking candidates by matching semi structured resumes of candidates to job descriptions. To perform this task, we propose to use a siamese adaptation of convolutional neural network. The proposed approach effectively captures the underlying semantics thus enabling to project similar resumes and job descriptions closer to each other, and make dissimilar resumes and job descriptions distant from each other in the semantic space. Our experimental results on a set of 1314 resumes and a set of 3809 job descriptions (5,005,026 resume-job description pairs) demonstrate that our approach is better than the current state-of-the-art approaches. © 2018 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.},

abstract={Due to the rapidly changing, dynamic nature of today's economic landscape, organizations are often engaged in a continuous exercise of matching their workforce with the changing needs of the marketplace. Re-skilling offers these enterprises the ability to effectively manage and retain talent, while also satisfying business requirements. We describe an analytics-based propensity scoring model for re-skilling by combining historical employee job-role/skill records, relationships between different job-roles/skills, employee resumes, and job postings. This is used to determine the source features that are the closest to a required target skill and hence identify employees that can be easily trained for the target skill. We evaluate this approach for a representative set of target skills at a multinational with a large services/consulting arm. We show that the propensity model learnt from the combined data sources has a high accuracy that is also substantially better than that achieved by using features from job-roles or resumes alone. The performance is improved further by using an ensemble model to evaluate the propensity scores. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In the last years, job recommender systems have become popular since they successfully reduce information overload by generating personalized job suggestions. Although in the literature exists a variety of techniques and strategies used as part of job recommender systems, most of them fail to recommending job vacancies that fit properly to the job seekers profiles. Thus, the contributions of this work are threefold, we: i) made publicly available a new dataset formed by a set of job seekers profiles and a set of job vacancies collected from different job search engine sites; ii) put forward the proposal of a framework for job recommendation based on professional skills of job seekers; and iii) carried out an evaluation to quantify empirically the recommendation abilities of two state-of-the-art methods, considering different configurations, within the proposed framework. We thus present a general panorama of job recommendation task aiming to facilitate research and real-world application design regarding this important issue.

abstract={Due to the constant growth in online recruitment, job portals are starting to receive thousands of resumes in diverse styles and formats from job seekers who have different fields of expertise and specialize in various domains. Accordingly, automatically extracting structured information from such resumes is needed not only to support the automatic matching between candidate resumes and their corresponding job offers, but also to efficiently route them to their appropriate occupational categories to minimize the effort required for managing and organizing them. As a result, instead of searching globally in the entire space of resumes and job posts, resumes that fall under a certain occupational category are only those that will be matched to their relevant job post. In this research work, we present a hybrid approach that employs conceptual-based classification of resumes and job postings and automatically ranks candidate resumes (that fall under each category) to their corresponding job offers. In this context, we exploit an integrated knowledge base for carrying out the classification task and experimentally demonstrate - using a real-world recruitment dataset- achieving promising precision results compared to conventional machine learning based resume classification approaches. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={Inefficiencies in the labor market such as friction in matching members to jobs and the existence of skill gaps in various sectors of the economy are considered to be major problems facing economies today. The central premise of our work is that increasing the productivity of a member of the workforce (and thereby of the economy as a whole) crucially depends on identifying and recommending skills whose acquisition will yield the highest utility gains for that member. To this end, we develop novel unsupervised Bayesian multi-view models BayesMatch and NpBayesMatch which can match members to other similar members as well as relevant jobs using shared features. The matching step is followed by a skill recommendation step SkillR which makes demand-based skill recommendations to members. Our extensive quantitative evaluation using a rich dataset comprised of member profiles and job postings from LinkedIn suggests that skill recommendations made by our algorithm are highly correlated with skills demanded in heldout future jobs compared to those made by traditional collaborative filtering algorithms that do not utilize information about skill demand. This indicates that either members of the workforce do not have skills demanded by jobs or do not have enough information about which are the best skills to signal for competing in the labor market. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={With the development of Internet technology, online job-hunting plays an increasingly important role in job-searching. It is difficult for job hunters to solely rely on keywords retrieving to find positions which meet their needs. To solve this issue, we adopted item-based collaborative filtering algorithm for job recommendations. In this paper, we optimized the algorithm by combining position descriptions and resume information. Specifically, job preference prediction formula is optimized by historical delivery weight calculated by position descriptions and similar user weight calculated by resume information. The experiments tested on real data set have shown that our methods have a significant improvement on job recommendation results. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The world's population is graying at an unprecedented rate. Promoting senior engagement in the workforce is essential to enhancing senior QOL and mitigating aging-related problems of society by maintaining and encouraging their health, strength, and skills. We argue that we need an innovative matching system of senior workers to jobs. However, effective and appropriate matching and retrieval methods have not been established. We will first introduce four user interfaces that extract user information and label jobs. Then, we will examine the algorithm used to match workers with jobs and to update work profiles. Based on our theory, we built an online consumer-to-consumer/provider matching platform, GBER, where senior workers can find local jobs. We analyzed the log data we collected through our pilot study in Kashiwa, Japan, over seven month with 92 senior users. Our results demonstrated a viable approach to increasing senior involvement in their communities.},

The method proposed finds the optimal combination of skills from two or more CVs that best satisfies a job description. In our approach the CV sets as well as the job description are described semantically by using a skilltaxonomy. To evaluate the quality of a solution (i.e. a set of CVs that satisfies the job description considered) we have defined a fitness function that evaluates the degree of semantic matching of the combination of skills part of the considered solution to the set of skills of the job description. The method proposed has been tested on a set of 1000 CVs in the domain of computer science, the set being developed in house. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Online jobs search through popular websites are quite beneficial having served for many years as a prominent tool for job seekers and employers alike. In spite of their valuable utility in linking employers with potential employees, the search process and technology utilized by job search websites have not kept pace with the rapid changes in computing capability and machine intelligence. The Information retrieval techniques utilized by these websites rely primarily on variants of manually entered search queries with some advanced similarity metrics for ranking search results. Advancements in machine intelligence techniques have enabled programmatic extraction of pertinent information about the job seeker and job postings without active user input. To this end, we developed a resume matching system, RésuMatcher, which intelligently extracts the qualifications and experience of a job seeker directly from his/her résumé, and relevant information about the qualifications and experience requirements of job postings. Using a novel statistical similarity index, RésuMatcher returns results that are more relevant to the job seekers experience, academic, and technical qualifications, with minimal active user input. Our method provides up to a 34% improvement over existing information retrieval methods in the quality of search results. In addition however, RésuMatcher requires minimal active user input to search for jobs, compared to traditional manual search-based methods prevalent today. These improvements, we hypothesize, will lead to more relevant job search results and a better overall job search experience for job seekers. As an alternative to the fragmented organization-centric job application process, job recruitment websites offered the promise of simplifying and streamlining the job search process. However, these websites offer limited functionality using generic and simplistic information retrieval methods, which being non-domain lead to a poor and frustrating search experience. In this paper, we present RésuMatcher, a personalized job-résumé matching system, which offers a novel statistical similarity index for ranking relevance between candidate résumés and a database of available jobs. In our experiments we show that our method offers a 37.44% improvement over existing information retrieval methods in the quality of matches returned. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The majority of new jobs in the U.S. is filled by workers coming from employment or from out of the labor force (inactivity). Yet, because the number of job seekers in these groups is unobserved, they are often ignored in empirical labor market studies. This paper, instead, uses latent-variable techniques to estimate the aggregate matching function - a relation between hires, vacant jobs and job seekers - while considering searchers from unemployment, employment and inactivity. Importantly, the estimation allows for the (match) efficiency with which these three groups of searchers find jobs to vary on average and over time. This paper finds that almost half of the rise in U.S. unemployment during the Great Recession is explained by a drop in match efficiency of the unemployed. This contrasts sharply with previous studies which found match efficiency to be quantitatively unimportant. © 2016 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract={This article studies entrepreneurial education and its impact on job-skills matches for higher education graduates. Those who possess entrepreneurial skills are assumed to be more market aware and creative in their job search. They are also expected to foresee which job offers would and would not, match their skills. Using a large comparative survey (REFLEX-HEGESCO) to test this hypothesis, we show that higher levels of entrepreneurial skills (defined as scanning and search, association and connection, and evaluation and judgement) reduce the probability of over-education for university graduates in 18 OECD countries five years after graduation. Entrepreneurial education helps individuals to obtain better jobs, even if they search for wage employment and not for self-employment. Resorting to a multilevel regression, our results indicate a stronger need for training in entrepreneurial skills at higher education institutions on the one hand, and the introduction of policies that promote innovation at the micro and macro levels in countries' economy, on the other. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Due to the rapid development of job markets, traditional recruitment methods are becoming insufficient. This is because employers often receive an enormous number of applications (usually unstructured resumes) that are difficult to process and analyze manually. To address this issue, several automatic recruitment systems have been proposed. Although these systems have proved to be more effective in processing candidate resumes and matching them to their relevant job posts, they still suffer from low precision due to limitations of their underlying techniques. On the one hand, approaches based on keyword matching ignore the semantics of the job post and resume contents, and consequently a large portion of the matching results is irrelevant. On the other hand, the more recent semantics-based models are influenced by the limitations of the used semantic resources, namely the incompleteness of the knowledge captured by such resources and their limited domain coverage. In this paper, we propose an automatic online recruitment system that employs multiple semantic resources to highlight the semantic contents of resumes and job posts. Additionally, it utilizes statistical concept-relatedness measures to further enrich the highlighted contents with relevant concepts that were not initially recognized by the used semantic resources. The proposed system has been instantiated and validated in a precision-recall based empirical framework. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The advent of the Web brought about major changes in the way people search for jobs and companies look for suitable candidates. As more employers and recruitment firms turn to the Web for job candidate search, an increasing number of people turn to the Web for uploading and creating their online resumes. Resumes are often the first source of information about candidates and also the first item of evaluation in candidate selection. Thus, it is imperative that resumes are complete, free of errors and well-organized. We present an automated resume evaluation tool called 'CareerMapper'. Our tool is designed to conduct a thorough review of a user's LinkedIn profile and provide best recommendations for improved online resumes by analyzing a large number of online user profiles. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In the aging Japanese society, most elderly people still have enough energy to work and have the potential to become essential labor forces. A job matching method that can allocate their unique abilities is required. However, the current job matching relies on each recruiter’s tacit knowledge, and the recruiter assigns only specific candidates to work profiles. In this paper, we propose an interactive job matching system that can reflect the recruiter’s tacit knowledge and help search for diverse elderly workers for each work profile. The results indicate that interactions of the proposed system can improve the matching diversity by retrieving recruiters’ tacit knowledge. When there is a work profile in which it is difficult to extract appropriate keywords, our interactions become most effective. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Until recently job seeking has been a tricky, tedious and time consuming process, because people looking for a new position had to collect information from many different sources. Job recommendation systems have been proposed in order to automate and simplify this task, also increasing its effectiveness. However, current approaches rely on scarce manually collected data that often do not completely reveal people skills. Our work aims to find out relationships between jobs and people skills making use of data from LinkedIn users' public profiles. Semantic associations arise by applying Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). We use the mined semantics to obtain a hierarchical clustering of job positions and to build a job recommendation system. The outcome proves the effectiveness of our method in recommending job positions. Anyway, we argue that our approach is definitely general, because the extracted semantics could be worthy not only for job recommendation systems but also for recruiting systems. Furthermore, we point out that both the hierarchical clustering and the recommendation system do not require parameters to be tuned. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS-Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={Personal resume is a widely used human resource selected method and decision reference. Individuals can improve their image through personal resume. Personal digital resume involves using information technology to develop qualified job seekers for employment. The aim of this study is to identify constructs and prioritize the measures of personal digital resume. FAHP(Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy process) is a synthetic extension of classical AHP method when the fuzziness of the decision makers is considered. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is utilized to gather and analyze data.A total of 29 people were selected and were a combination of 16 job seekers and 13 HR practitioners. Based on the results, the personal digital resume may be categorized into three dimensions: Internet image capital, Internet social capital, and Internet innovative capital. Additionally, the study develops 9 indicators for personal digital resume assessment. Ideas for theoretical and practical implementation are discussed.},

abstract={In today’s world, thousands of job seekers are looking for a new job. On the other hand, thousands of employers are trying to find new employees. So, this is a chaotic matching problem and it does not have a certain answer. Companies are searching career centers and web-based career software to find an answer for the question of “”Should we find a convenient worker for a certain role and hire this person or not?” Solution is that simple; just have a look at the beginning of the story: university career centers. In this study, a Career Center System Software has been designed and implemented for matching students with their ideal job. Career Center System Software (CCSS) is programmed on C#, MS-SQL and.NET platform. CCSS has been developed on Visual Studio 2010. CCSS is implemented in a way so as to enable the user to apply for the job announcements and to monitor courses and to call for conferences and seminars. Furthermore, CCSS enables companies to view the applicant’s curriculum vitae. All job announcements, educations, seminars and CVs are stored on the database. Software quality and testing shows that CCSS is implemented successfully and ready to use tool as Career Center Software. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={While many studies on big data analytics describe the data deluge and potential applications for such analytics, the required skill set for dealing with big data has not yet been studied empirically. The difference between big data (BD) and traditional business intelligence (BI) is also heavily discussed among practitioners and scholars. We conduct a latent semantic analysis (LSA) on job advertisements harvested from the online employment platform monster.com to extract information about the knowledge and skill requirements for BD and BI professionals. By analyzing and interpreting the statistical results of the LSA, we develop a competency taxonomy for big data and business intelligence. Our major findings are that (1) business knowledge is as important as technical skills for working successfully on BI and BD initiatives; (2) BI competency is characterized by skills related to commercial products of large software vendors, whereas BD jobs ask for strong software development and statistical skills; (3) the demand for BI competencies is still far bigger than the demand for BD competencies; and (4) BD initiatives are currently much more human-capital-intensive than BI projects are. Our findings can guide individual professionals, organizations, and academic institutions in assessing and advancing their BD and BI competencies. © Springer Fachmedien 2014.},

abstract={While Internet takes up by far the most significant part of our daily lives, finding jobs/employees on the Internet has started to play a crucial role for job seekers and employers. Online recruitment websites and human resources consultancy and recruitment companies enable job seekers to create their résumé, a brief written formal document including job seeker's basic information such as personal information, educational information, work experience and qualifications in order to find and apply for desirable jobs, whereas they enable companies to find qualified employees they are looking for. However résumés may be written in many ways that make it difficult for online recruitment companies to keep these data in their relational databases. In this study, a project that Kariyer.net (largest online recruitment website in Turkey) and TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) have been jointly working is proposed. In this mentioned project, a system enables free structured format of résumés to transform into an ontological structure model. The produced system based on ontological structure model and called Ontology based Résumé Parser (ORP) will be tested on a number of Turkish and English résumés. The proposed system will be kept in Semantic Web approach that provides companies to find expert finding in an efficient way. © 2013 IEEE.},

The candidate's resume and social media profiles are interwoven to build an augmented user profile. Similarly, the job description is augmented by external databases and user-generated content to build an enhanced job profile. These augmented user and job pro- files are then analyzed in order to develop numerical over- lap features each with strong discriminating power, and in sum with maximal coverage. The resulting feature scores are then combined into a single Bright Score using a cus- tom algorithm, where the feature weights are derived from a nation-wide and controlled study in which we collected a large sample of human judgments on real resume-job pair- ings. We demonstrate that the addition of social media pro- file data and external data improves the classification accu- racy dramatically in terms of identifying the most qualified candidates. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Today, soft skills are crucial factors to the success of a project. For a certain set of jobs, soft skills are often considered more crucial than the hard skills or technical skills, in order to perform the job effectively. However, it is not a trivial task to identify the appropriate soft skills for each job. In this light, this study proposed a solution to assist employers when preparing advertisement via identification of suitable soft skills together with its relevancy to that particular job title. Bayesian network is employed to solve this problem because it is suitable for reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The proposed Bayesian Network is trained using a dataset collected via extracting information from advertisements and also through interview sessions with a few identified experts. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Since web documents have different formats and contents; it is necessary for various documents to use standards to normalise their modelling in order to facilitate retrieval task. The model must take into consideration, both the syntactic structure, and the semantic content of the documents. Curriculum vitae (CV) is the document that summaries our education, skills, accomplishments, and experience. Job seekers submit their CV via the web. Therefore, in their recruitment process, companies are requiring systems for extraction and analysis of information from CVs: identifying specific patterns, which meet with certain profile. To extract the essential component of CVs and to relate them with user’s require, needs first, a study of their most significant elements and a better understanding of the CV feature. This work focuses on CVs’ analysis. It introduces an approach for analysing and structuring CVs which are in French. To this end, we make an extension of General Architecture of Text Engineering (GATE). The extension affects essentially a formulation of logic rules for the generation of annotations used for CV handling. The goal is to normalise the CV content according to the structure adopted by Europass CV. This action is guided by the HR-XML standard. We experiment the proposed process and we showed that there is an improvement in the extraction phase. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={In the Internet era, the enterprises and companies receive thousands of resumes from the job seekers. Currently available filtering techniques and search services help the recruiters to filter thousands of resumes to few hundred potential ones. Since these filtered resumes are similar to each other, it is difficult to identify the potential resumes by examining each resume. We are investigating the issues related to the development of approaches to improve the performance of resume selection process. We have extended the notion of special features and proposed an approach to identify resumes with special skill information. In the literature, the notion of special features have been applied to improve the process of product selection in E-commerce environment. However, extending the notion of special features for the development of approach to process resumes is a complex task as resumes contain unformatted text or semi-formatted text. In this paper, we have proposed an approach by considering only skills related information of the resumes. The experimental results on the real world data-set of resumes show that the proposed approach has the potential to improve the process of resume selection. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Private organizations like offices, libraries, hospi-tals make use of computers for computerized database, when computers became a most cost-effective device.After than E.F Codd introduced relational database model i.e conventional database. Conventional database can be enhanced to temporal database. Conventional or traditional databases are structured in nature. But always we dont have the pre-organized data. We have to deal with different types of data. That data is huge and in large amount i.e Big data. Big data mostly emphasized into internal data sources like transaction, log data, emails etc. From these sources high-enriched information is extracted by the means of process text data mining or text analytics. Entity Extraction is a part of Text Analysis. An entity can be anything like people, companies, places, money, any links, phone number etc. Text documents, bLogposts or any long articles contain large number of entities in many forms. Extracting those entities to gain the valuable information is the main target. Extraction of entities is possible in natural language processing(NLP) with R language. In this research work we will briefly discuss about text analysis process and how to extract entities with different big data tools. },

author={Mazzola, Luca and Siegfried, Patrick and Waldis, Andreas and Stalder, Florian and Denzler, Alexander and Kaufmann, Michael},
abstract={In this work, our research goal is to create an expert system for education recommendation, based on skills, capabilities, areas of expertise present in someone’s curriculum vitae and personal preferences. This form of semantic text matching challenge needs to take into account all the personal educational experiences (formal, informal, and on-the-job), but also work-related know-how, to create a concept based profile of the person. This will allow a reasoned matching process from CVs and career vision to descriptions of education programs. Taking inspiration from the explicit semantic analysis (ESA), we developed a domain-specific approach to semantically characterize short texts and to compare their content for semantic similarity. Thanks to an enriching and a filtering process, we transform the general purpose German Wikipedia into a domain specific model for our task. The domain is defined also through a German knowledge base or vocabulary of description for educational experiences and for job offers. Initial testing with a small set of documents demonstrated that our approach covers the main requirements and can match semantically similar text content. This is applied in a use case and an implementation of an education recommender system prototype.},

title={A framework for enriching job vacancies and job descriptions through bidirectional matching},
author={Chala, Sisay Adugna and Ansari, Fazel and Fathi, Madjid},
abstract={There is a huge online data about job descriptions which has been entered by job seekers and job holders that can be utilized to give insight into the current state of jobs. Employers also produce large volume of vacancy data online which can be exploited to portray the current demand of the job market. When preparing job vacancies, taking into account the information contained in job descriptions, and vice versa, the likelihood of getting the bidirectional match of a job description and a vacancy will be improved. To improve the quality of job descriptions and job vacancies, a mediating system is required that connects and supports job designers and employers, respectively. In this paper, we propose a framework of an automatic bidirectional matching system that measures the degree of semantic similarity of job descriptions provided by job-seeker, job-holder or job-designer against the vacancy provided by employer or job-agent. The system provides suggestions to improve both job descriptions and vacancies using a combination of text mining methods. },

author={Hong, Wenxing and Zheng, Siting and Wang, Huan and Shi, Jianchao},
abstract={In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive investigation of four online job recommender systems (JRSs) from four different aspects: user profiling, recommendation strategies, recommendation output, and user feedback. In particular, we summarize the pros and cons of these online JRSs and highlight their differences. We then discuss the challenges in building high-quality JRSs. One main challenge lies on the design of recommendation strategies since different job applicants may have different characteristics. To address the aforementioned challenge, we develop an online JRS, iHR, which groups users into different clusters and employs different recommendation approaches for different user clusters. As a result, iHR has the capability of choosing the appropriate recommendation approaches according to users’ characteristics. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.},

abstract={This paper aims to review artificial intelligence (AI) implementation in the Human Resources Management (HRM) recruitment processes. A systematic review was adopted in which academic papers, magazine articles as well as high rated websites with related fields were checked. This study's findings should contribute to the general understanding of AI's impact on the HRM recruitment process. It was impossible to track and cover all topics related to the subject. However, the research methodology seems reasonable and acceptable as it covers a good number of articles related to the core subject area. The results and findings were almost precise that using AI is advantageous in the area of recruitment as technology can serve best in this area. Moreover, time, effort, and boring daily tasks are transformed into computerized, making adequate space for humans to focus on more important subjects related to boosting performance and development. Acquiring automation and cognitive insights as well as cognitive engagement in the recruitment process would make it possible for systems to work similarly to the human brain in terms of data analysis and the ability to build an effective systematic engagement to process the data in an unbiased, efficient and fast way. },

title={A novel firefly driven scheme for resume parsing and matching based on entity linking paradigm},
author={Deepak, Gerard and Teja, Varun and Santhanavijayan, A},
abstract={In this paper, contemporary Natural Language Processing techniques have been leveraged to demonstrate the capability of data-driven HR towards significant improvement in the quality and speed of the whole recruiting process. Firstly, by using NLP, a resume parser has been implemented to analyze the most crucial recruitment parameters. Thereafter, ability to display a pie chart for a candidate has been employed in the algorithmic structure of the parser to prepare a powerful tool for the resume matching based on job criteria. To determine the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed resume ranker, an enhanced rival modern optimizer, i.e., firefly ranking algorithm is applied to accelerate the speed of ranking algorithm. An overall accuracy of 94.19% has been achieved by the proposed approach. The results indicate that the resume parser has been incorporated with robust techniques and hence concedes to the accuracy of the results.},

title={A review of machine learning applications in human resource management},
author={Garg, Swati and Sinha, Shuchi and Kar, Arpan Kumar and Mani, Mauricio},
abstract={A semi-systematic approach has been used in this review. It allows for a more detailed analysis of the literature which emerges from multiple disciplines and uses different methods and theoretical frameworks. Since ML research comes from multiple disciplines and consists of several methods, a semi-systematic approach to literature review was considered appropriate. The review suggests that HRM has embraced ML, albeit it is at a nascent stage and is receiving attention largely from technology-oriented researchers. ML applications are strongest in the areas of recruitment and performance management and the use of decision trees and text-mining algorithms for classification dominate all functions of HRM. For complex processes, ML applications are still at an early stage; requiring HR experts and ML specialists to work together.},

title={A survey of job recommender systems},
author={Al-Otaibi, Shaha T and Ykhlef, Mourad},
abstract={The Internet-based recruiting platforms become a primary recruitment channel in most companies. While such platforms decrease the recruitment time and advertisement cost, they suffer from an inappropriateness of traditional information retrieval techniques like the Boolean search methods. Consequently, a vast amount of candidates missed the opportunity of recruiting. The recommender system technology aims to help users in finding items that match their personnel interests; it has a successful usage in e-commerce applications to deal with problems related to information overload efficiently. In order to improve the e-recruiting functionality, many recommender system approaches have been proposed. This article will present a survey of e-recruiting process and existing recommendation approaches for building personalized recommender systems for candidates/job matching.},

abstract={With the growing use of more and more data on networks, big data has become the new trend for productivity, innovation and competition across companies and industries. The proliferation of textual data in businesses is overwhelming. Unstructured or semi-structured textual data is being constantly generated via web logs, emails, documents on the web, blogs, and so on. While the amount of textual data is increasing very rapidly, the ability to summarize, analyze which make sense of such data for making good business decisions This paper reviews how to organize and understand the textual data and presents an unstructured text analytics approach for qualitative evaluation of CV/Resume documents. This paper proposes an effective approach for extracting the resume information from websites and analyzing it thereby making the job easier for finding suitable resumes. The survey results in obtaining fair measure of qualitative account of a resume document on the parameters of coverage, readability and comprehensibility demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed algorithmic approach},

title={Algorithmic Hiring in Practice: Recruiter and HR Professional’s Perspectives on AI Use in Hiring},
author={Li, Lan and Lassiter, Tina and Oh, Joohee and Lee, Min Kyung},
abstract={The increasing adoption of AI-enabled hiring software raises questions about the practice of Human Resource (HR) professionals’ use of the software and its consequences. We interviewed 15 recruiters and HR professionals who used AI-enabled hiring software for two decision-making processes in hiring: sourcing and assessment. For both, AI-enabled software allowed the efficient processing of candidate data, thus providing the ability to introduce or advance candidates from broader and more diverse pools. For sourcing, it can serve as a useful learning resource to find candidates. Though, a lack of trust in data accuracy and an inadequate level of control over algorithmic candidate matches can create reluctance to embrace it. For assessment, its implementation varied across companies depending on the industry and the hiring scenario. Its inclusion may redefine HR professionals’ job content as it automates or augments pieces of the existing hiring process. Our research highlights the importance of understanding the contextual factors that shape how algorithmic hiring is practiced in organizations.},

abstract={In a recruitment industry, selecting a best CV from a particular job post within a pile of thousand CV's is quite challenging. Finding a perfect candidate for an organization who can be fit to work within organizational culture is a difficult task. In order to help the recruiters to fill these gaps we leverage the help of AI. We propose a methodology to solve these problems by matching the skill graph generated from CV and Job Post. In this report our approach is to perform the business understanding in order to justify why such problems arise and how we intend to solve these problems using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. We limit our project only to solve the problem in the domain of the computer science industry.},

author={Islam, Md Moinul and Yasmin, Farzana and Arefin, Mohammad Shamsul and Ayon, Zaber Al Hassan and Ripan, Rony Chowdhury},
abstract={Recruiting or selecting the right candidates from a vast pool of candidates has always been a fundamental issue in Bangladesh as far as employers are concerned. In the case of candidate recruitment, different government organizations, nowadays, ask the applicants to submit their applications or resumes written in Bengali in the form of electronic documents. Matching the skills with the requirements and choosing the best candidates manually from all the resumes written in Bengali is very difficult and time-consuming. To make the recruitment process more comfortable, we have developed an automated candidate selection system. First, it takes the CVs (written in Bengali) of candidates and the employer’s requirements as input. It extracts information from the candidate’s CV using Bangla Language Processing (BLP) and Word2Vec embedding. Then, it generates an average cosine similarity score for each CV. Finally, it ranks the candidates according to the average cosine similarity scores and returns the dominant candidate’s list.},

abstract={Recruitment is a significant process that affects to organizational performance. Recruiters expect to meet the most appropriate employee for the right job, but a large number of resumes make more difficult to their decision. For this reason, this paper proposed the recommender system to support recruiter in the decision and manage recruitments. The two techniques include matching and collaborative filtering. In the matching process, it compares the profile data and takes a score in order to rank the candidates. However, the scoring remains some problem that candidate scores are low dispersion. Therefore, the collaborative filtering technique was used to solve scoring problem. By applying this technique, the results shown that the scores were adjusted the distinction. Thus, the collaborative filtering could improve the score dispersion and easy to identify the most appropriate candidates, who had the best required qualification.},

title={Applying Learning-to-Rank to Human Resourcing's Job-Candidate Matching Problem: A Case Study.},
author={Braun, H},
abstract={A challenge that every company or organization will continue to face regularly is the task of recruiting people that will perfectly fit their vacant jobs. This is especially vital for companies in the Human Resourcing industry, like employment agencies and secondment companies, whose livelihood depend on selecting the right candidates. This selection process is currently performed by Human Resourcing professionals. The first step commonly consists of manually searching through the available applicants, eventually producing a list of suitable candidates that get invited to the next phase of the application process. This already labor intensive process has been made even more challenging with the advent of online job recruitment. This made finding and posting vacancies simpler, but also increased the number of applicants. However, the digitization of recruitment can alleviate this information over- load by, for example, providing the Human Resourcer with an ordering of the applicants, based on their estimated suitability for a given position. For the NCIM-Group, a secondment company near Leidschendam, Learning- to-Rank, a type of Machine Learning, was applied to automatically induce a way to do just this: to order a list of candidates based on a given job offer. The ranking model was learned from the company's historical placement data. There are many ways of solving the learning-to-rank problem. Three state- of-the-art models, each one exemplifying one of the three common approaches, the point- pair- and list-wise approach, have been implemented to identify which one is best suited for this problem. Speci fically, a Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) model (a point-wise method), a LambdaMART model (a pair- wise method) and a SmoothRank model (a list-wise method) were applied. Their performance, plus a baseline Best-Single-Feature model, were compared with the existing Evolutionary Algorithm model on two common rank-based evaluation measures: Mean Average Precision (MAP) and mean Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). All three methods improved the performance signi ficantly compared to the existing algorithm, with an increase in MAP score up to 59.7% (GBRT-model vs. Evo.-model, p = 0:0001). Additional results indicate that adding Manifold Regularization, a semi- supervised technique, to SmoothRank may improve its performance slightly by 6% (although not statistically significant).},

abstract={Nowadays, almost everything is equipped with technology. People can save time by using modern day technological applications in the most convenient way. Smart Interviewing System is one such software/tool which automates the traditional interviewing process using modern Natural Language Processing techniques and deep learning applications. The system will be mainly beneficial for interviewers and HR management employees working for different organizations who conduct technology related interviews. The system works with human voice and writing patterns. The system converts human language into system understandable text-based inputs, and these are used as inputs in the automated interviewing process. The system then checks the accuracy of the answers which candidates provided on the both oral interviews/ technical interviews and written tests. Later, the system automatically predicts scores for each answer using concepts of the deep learning. Interviewers can reduce the effort that they have to put in for selecting the most suitable candidates who are qualified enough to work with their organization. SIS is developed based on modern DL and NLP concepts using Python programming language alongside with ReactJS Framework. This system checking and evaluating candidate more accurately in every stage of the interview using advance evaluation parameters than human oriented evaluations. Above process lead system to find more human errors which critically can be affected to future of the organizations. Because of that, it can be led organizations to find best human resources comparing to the traditional interviewing process by sacrificing less time and effort.},

author={Nimbekar, Rohini and Patil, Yoqesh and Prabhu, Rahul and Mulla, Shainila},
abstract={Recruiting candidates to fit a particular job profile is a task crucial to most of the companies. Due to increasing growth in online recruitment, traditional hiring methods are becoming inefficient. The conventional techniques usually include a labor-intensive process of manually searching through the applied candidates, reviewing their resumes, and then producing a shortlist of suitable candidates to be interviewed. In this era of technology, job searching has become smarter and more accessible at the same time. The companies receive enormous numbers of resumes/CVs, which are not always structured. There have been lots of work done for the job searching process. Whereas, the process of selecting a candidate based on their resume has not been entirely automated. This research proposes a model of extracting valuable information from the resume and ranking it according to the preference and requirement of the company. To achieve the desired goal, the entire process has been divided into three segments. The first segment consists of converting the unstructured resumes in structured data using NLP, and the second segment consists of the extraction phase, where the relevant information is extracted from the resume and giving them an identifier value. Finally, based on the values assigned, the resumes are ranked accordingly in the final segment.},

author={Li, Changmao and Fisher, Elaine and Thomas, Rebecca and Pittard, Steve and Hertzberg, Vicki and Choi, Jinho D},
abstract={This paper presents a comprehensive study on resume classification to reduce the time and labor needed to screen an overwhelming number of applications significantly, while improving the selection of suitable candidates. A total of 6,492 resumes are extracted from 24,933 job applications for 252 positions designated into four levels of experience for Clinical ResearchCoordinators (CRC). Each resume is manually annotated to its most appropriate CRC position by experts through several rounds of triple annotation to establish guidelines. As a result, a high Kappa score of 61% is achieved for inter-annotator agreement. Given this dataset, novel transformer-based classification models are developed for two tasks: the first task takes a resume and classifies it to a CRC level (T1), and the second task takes both a resume and a job description to apply and predicts if the application is suited to the job (T2). Our best models using section encoding and multi-head attention decoding give results of 73.3% toT1and79.2% toT2. Our analysis shows that the prediction errors are mostly made among adjacent CRC levels, which are hard for even experts to distinguish, implying the practical value of our models in real HR platforms},

author={Laurim, Vanessa and Arpaci, Selin and Prommegger, Barbara and Krcmar, Helmut},
abstract={In the war for talents, the need for appropriate tools to fill open positions with the right talents is becoming increasingly important for employers. AI-based technologies simplify recruiters’ daily work and increase the efficiency of the recruitment process by replacing time-consuming approaches. However, little is known about the reactions of stakeholders to AI-based recruiting. Thus, this paper aims to identify personal and contextual factors that influence the acceptance of AI-based technologies in the recruitment process. Based on the interviews with recruiters, managers, and applicants involved in the recruitment process, we present that transparency, complementary features of the AI tools, and a sense of control play key roles in the acceptance of AI-based technology when used for recruiting.

title={Data-Driven Information Filtering Framework for Dynamically Hybrid Job Recommendation},
author={Heggo, Islam A and Abdelbaki, Nashwa},
abstract={Recommender system is a mature concept that periodically evolves. It is relating to more than one branch of knowledge such as data mining, machine learning, information retrieval, natural language processing and human-computer interaction. Nowadays recommender systems impose themselves to be a core model in all the present modern web applications. They are obviously found in numerous industries such as videos recommendation by Youtube and products recommendation by Amazon. Similarly, recommendation systems are incredibly required in the challenging e-recruitment domain. In e-recruitment domain, it is mandatory to build an intelligent system that digs deeper into thousands of jobs to eventually filter out the relevant jobs for each job-seeker. We explain what it needs to build such sophisticated and practical hybrid engine. The engine is practically employed in a dynamic e-recruitment portal and it has already proven its efficiency in the real-world market. We utilized many applied recommendation approaches in other several industries to empower the field of e-recruitment. Our project aims to recommend relevant jobs for job-seekers to solve the problem of disrupting job-seekers with irrelevant jobs to improve users’ satisfaction and loyalty.}keywords={Information retrieval; Hybrid recommender system; Machine learning; Search engine; Ranking Context-aware; Personalization},

abstract={Individuals play a significant role to enhance and accelerate the performance of the organizations and hiring right employees, is indeed a challenging task. It is because many people show interest in the single job opening. HR in large organizations, recruits and explores such people by following proper recruitment process. This recruitment process has been proven to be lengthy, tidy and costly because of a substantial number of applicants. Recruitment of suitable individuals becomes more difficult for smaller organizations as they do not have HR department. Automation can improve the process though. By doing this, the process becomes shorter, easier, and cost effective. In that respect several automated recruiting systems have been proposed in the literature. The primary limitation of the existing recruitment systems is that it simply picks out those candidates who meet the (100%) skills set and turns down the rest of them yet if they are meeting the partial criteria. It intends that as these programs have been projected to pick only those who are gathering all the prerequisites. In fact, the recruitment system can select the candidates that are even meeting the near about or close requirements. It is because if a candidate does not meet (100%), then the candidate with the lesser requirement should be kept under consideration. There can be chances where a person meeting 9 out of 10 requirements could have proved to be the best choice, but because of the system we lose such candidates. The current research proposes a Fuzzy logic-based decision support system (DSS), to overcome the above-mentioned limitation. Abiding by the Fuzzy logic, the proposed system can view the partial skills of the applicants. The system has been validated by implementing the prototype. The outcomes depict a significant improvement to overcome the limitation of the existing recruitment systems.}keywords={DSS; E-RECRUITMENT; FUZZY RULE BASED SYSTEM},

title={Developing a Framework for Potential Candidate Selection},
author={Yasmin, Farzana and Nur, Mohammad Imtiaz and Arefin, Mohammad Shamsul},
abstract={Recruitment is the process of hiring the right person for the right job. In the current competitive world, recruiting the right person from thousands of applicants is a tedious work. In addition, analyzing these huge numbers of applications manually might result into biased and erroneous output which may eventually cause problems for the companies. If these pools of resumes can be analyzed automatically and presented to the employers in a systematic way for choosing the appropriate person for their company, it may help the applicants and the employers as well. So in order to solve this need, we have developed a framework that takes the resume of the candidates, pull out information from them by recognizing the named entities using machine learning and score the applicants according to some predefined rules and employer requirements. Furthermore, employers can select the best suited candidates for their jobs from these scores by using skyline filtering.},

abstract={The current research illustrates the pattern of job encounters with unemployed workers. Today everyone has to work. As a result, they look for a job and life balance that matches their abilities. Every graduate has many opportunities in the workplace. But they can find one job from another. That's why we need a job agency to find employees. This paper proposes a work agency system. The purpose of this paper is to identify the work of employees' qualifications. In this system, there are registered agents, including job seekers and employers. User interface Job Search Agent Contains CV creator and employer. Job seekers can register our system using an interface agent and use a register agent. The job seeker can use the job search agent to find a job. They can create the CV first and apply for the job. Employers can use our system to find qualified employees and register agents.},

author={Keim, Tobias},
abstract={Recommender systems (RS) so far have been applied to many fields of e-commerce in order to assist users in finding the products that best meet their preferences. However, while the application of RS to the search for objects is well established, this is not the case for the search for subjects. This is astonishing as a growing number of people make personal and professional information digitally available to others by managing profiles in CV databases, social networking platforms and other online services. In order to address this new field of application for RS, we integrate own prior research into a unified multilayer framework supporting the matching of individuals for recruitment and team staffing processes. By this means we enhance RS research and make a next step towards the development of empirically and theoretically grounded decision support for the human resources function},

title={Finding the best job applicants for a job posting: A comparison of human resources search strategies},
author={Harris, Christopher G},
abstract={Finding the best candidates to match a set of job requirements can be viewed as both an art and a science. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study using actual job candidates and job applicants. We compare the ranked lists generated by executive recruiting experts with the list generated by three search strategies: one using crowdworkers in a gamified environment, a second using information retrieval-based search methods, and a third method which combines information retrieval methods and weighted feature-based approach. We examine these three strategies across two separate job categories - technical and non-technical (management). Our study finds the gamified-enhanced crowdsourcing environment works best for ranking candidates for technical jobs while the text mining and gamified crowdsourcing environments perform equally well for ranking candidates for non-technical jobs. Last, we discuss possible reasons for our results as well as suggest possible enhancements to reduce the gap between our strategies and the HR executive recruiting experts.keywords={crowdsourcing; data mining; feature extraction; information retrieval; job specification; recruitment; text analysis},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a content-based recommendation Algorithm which extends and updates the Minkowski distance in order to address the challenge of matching people and jobs. The proposed algorithm FoDRA (Four Dimensions Recommendation Algorithm) quantifies the suitability of a job seeker for a job position in a more flexible way, using a structured form of the job and the candidate's profile, produced from a content analysis of the unstructured form of the job description and the candidate's CV. We conduct an experimental evaluation in order to check the quality and the effectiveness of FoDRA. Our primary study shows that FoDRA produces promising results and creates new prospects in the area of Job Recommender Systems (JRSs).},

author={Vukadin, Davor and Kurdija, Adrian Satja and Dela{\v{c}}, Goran and {\v{S}}ili{\'c}, Marin},
abstract={This paper proposes two natural language processing models for extracting useful information from multilingual, unstructured (free form) CV documents. The model identifies the relevant document sections (personal information, education, employment, etc.) and the corresponding specific information at the lower hierarchy level (names, addresses, roles, skill competences, etc.). Our approach employs the transformer architecture and its multilingual implementation of the encoder part in the form of the BERT language model. The models are trained and tested on a large, manually annotated CV dataset, achieving high scores on standard accuracy measures. The proposed models exhibit important properties of end-to-end training and interpretability, which was investigated by visualizing the model attention and its vector representations.},

abstract={This research analyzes how digital technologies contribute to improving the successive stages of the recruitment process: identifying, selecting, and retaining talented people. E-recruitment is an emerging and polymorphous phenomenon that starts with identification of candidates on social networks, continues through gamification of recruitment and job interviews with chatbots, and ends by matching a candidate and a job using artificial intelligence. These technologies are particularly useful for social businesses looking to recruit not only skilled people, but above all employees who have behaviors and values that match their mission. The methodology is based on grounded theory, participant observation, and qualitative data collection. A multiple case study is designed to analyze, compare, and combine several technologies dedicated to recruitment: (1) a social network with LinkedIn, (2) a MOOC with Udacity, (3) a serious game called Reveal from L'Oréal, (4) a chatbot called Ari from TextRecruit, and (5) a massive data analysis matching system with Randstad.tech. The discussion examines the respective performance and limits of these tools and their convergence via a progressive integration that leads to an uberization of recruitment. Managerial recommendations are formulated to support recruiters in their adoption of e-recruitment.},

abstract={The developed system is job recommendation system for campus recruitment which helps college placement office to match company’s profiles and student’s profiles with higher precision and lower cost. For profile matching, two matching methods are used: semantic matching, tree-based knowledge matching and query matching. These methods are integrated according to representations of attributes of students and companies, and then the profile similarity degree is acquired. Based on profile similarity degree, preference lists of companies and students are generated. Also students can perform keyword based search for job profiles from various job recruitment sites (e.g. Naukari.com,indeed.com). For obtaining data from online recruitment sites system uses web crawling. With loop matching, matching results would be further optimized and provide more effective guidance for recommendation. },

title={Job recommendation systems for enhancing e-recruitment process},
author={Al-Otaibi, Shaha T and Ykhlef, Mourad},
abstract={The Internet caused a substantial impact on the recruitment process through the creation of e- recruiting platforms that become a primary recruitment channel in most companies. While companies established job positions on these portals, job-seeker uses them to publish their profiles. E-recruitment platforms accomplished clear advantages for both recruiters and job-seekers by reducing the recruitment time and advertisement cost. However, these platforms suffer from an inappropriateness of traditional information retrieval techniques like the Boolean search methods that caused many applicants missed the opportunity of recruiting. Recommender system technology aims to help users in finding items that match their preferences; it has a successful usage in a wide-range of applications to deal with problems related to information overload efficiently. In order to improve the e-recruiting functionality, many recommender system approaches have been proposed. This paper will analyze e-recruiting process and related issues for building personalized recommender systems of candidates/job matching. },

On the other side, most people nowadays specially in the IT-sector use the Internet to look for jobs, however, given the huge amount of job postings online, it can be complicated for a candidate to short-list the right ones for applying to. In this work we test a collection of Machine Learning algorithms and through the usage of cross-validation we calibrate the most important hyper-parameters of each algorithm. The learning algorithms attempt to learn what makes a successful match between candidate profile and job requirements using for training historical data of selected/reject applications in the screening phase. The features we use for building our models include the similarities between the job requirements and the candidate profile in dimensions such as skills, profession, location and a set of job features which intend to capture the experience level, salary expectations, among others. In a first set of experiments, our best results emerge from the application of the Multilayer Perceptron algorithm (also known as Feed-Forward Neural Networks). After this, we improve the skills-matching feature by applying techniques for semantically embedding required/offered skills in order to tackle problems such as synonyms and typos which artificially degrade the similarity between job profile and candidate profile and degrade the overall quality of the results. Through the usage of word2vec algorithm for embedding skills and Multilayer Perceptron to learn the overall matching we obtain our best results. We believe our results could be even further improved by extending the idea of semantic embedding to other features and by finding candidates with similar job preferences with the target candidate and building upon that a richer presentation of the candidate profile. We consider that the final model we present in this work can be deployed in production as a firstlevel tool for doing the heavy-lifting of screening all applications, then passing the top N matches for manual inspection. Also, the results of our model can be used to complement any recommendation system in place by simply running the model encoding the profile of all candidates in the database upon any new job opening and recommend the jobs to the candidates which yield higher matching probability. },

title={Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and ontological concepts to Support e-recruitment},
author={Al-lasassmeh, Khaleel Quftan},
abstract={Nowadays, supporting e-recruitment by new techniques and applications is one of the major research topics of applied semantic ontology. Most of the latest works, in this domain, has focused on analyzing the contents of CVs and matching them with job postings in order to find the most relevant CVs to a certain job posting. In this research, we present a new approach based on combining ontological concepts and latent semantic analysis together to match between CVs and job postings. This research investigates building a matrix in LSA that is based on using the ontological concepts and instances instead of words that are used in the traditional approaches. It also investigates enhancing the clustering using the concepts and instances. Our approach is better than other approaches in the sense that it takes into account the meanings and relationships among words, and also considers different words that have same meaning and words that are semantically equivalent. By implementing our methodology on a set of CVs and matching them with an actual job posting, and comparing our results with the results of other traditional approaches, our approach achieved 84% accuracy, which higher than all other approaches.},

title={Machine Learning and Perceived Age Stereotypes in Job Ads: Evidence from an Experiment},
author={Burn, Ian and Firoozi, Daniel and Ladd, Daniel and Neumark, David},
abstract={We explore whether ageist stereotypes in job ads are detectable using machine learning methods measuring the linguistic similarity of job-ad language to ageist stereotypes identified by industrial psychologists. We then conduct an experiment to evaluate whether this language is perceived as biased against older workers. We find that language classified by the machine learning algorithm as closely related to ageist stereotypes is perceived as ageist by experimental subjects. The scores assigned to the language related to ageist stereotypes are larger when responses are incentivized by rewarding participants for guessing how other respondents rated the language. These methods could potentially help enforce anti-discrimination laws by using job ads to predict or identify employers more likely to be engaging in age discrimination.},

title={Matching Job Applicants to Free Text Job Ads Using Semantic Networks and Natural Language Inference},
author={Thun, Anton},
abstract={Automated e-recruitment systems have been a focus for research in the past decade due to the amount of work required to screen suitable applicants to a job post, whose resumés and job ads are commonly submitted as free text. While recruitment organizations have data concerning applicant resumés and job ad descriptions, resumés are often confidential, limiting the use of direct deep learning methods. This presents an issue where traditional data-agnostic methods have greater potential to achieve good results in determining applicant suitability for a given job post. However, with the advent of transfer learning methods, it is possible to train language models independently of the task at hand, and thus independently of the available data. In this report, a language model fine-tuned on Natural Language Inference (NLI) via cross-lingual transfer learning is used for the job matching task. This is compared to a semantic method using Swedish taxonomies to construct networks with hierarchical and synonymy relations. As NLI may apply to arbitrary sentence pairs, the use of text segmentation to enhance the methods’ performance is also examined. The results show that the NLI approach is significantly better than a random suitability classifier, but is outperformed by the semantic method that achieved 34% better performance on the used dataset. The use of text segmentation had negligible effect on overall performance, but was shown to improve ranking of the top-most suitable applicants in relation to manual expert relevance scores.},

title={Matching jobs and resumes: a deep collaborative filtering task},
author={Schmitt, Thomas and Caillou, Philippe and Sebag, Michele},
abstract={ This paper tackles the automatic matching of job seekers and recruiters, based on the logs of a recruitment agency (CVs, job announcements and application clicks). Preliminary experiments reveal that good recommendation performances in collaborative filtering mode (emitting recommendations for a known recruiter using the click history) co-exist with poor performances in cold start mode (emitting recommendations based on the job announcement only). A tentative interpretation for these results is proposed, claiming that job seekers and recruiters − whose mother tongue is French − yet do not speak the same language. As first contribution, this paper shows that the information inferred from their interactions differs from the information contained in the CVs and job announcements. The second contribution is the hybrid system Majore (MAtching JObs and REsumes), where a deep neural net is trained to match the collaborative filtering representation properties. The experimental validation demonstrates Majore merits, with good matching performances in cold start mode.},

title={Matching people and jobs: A bilateral recommendation approach},
author={Malinowski, Jochen and Keim, Tobias and Wendt, Oliver and Weitzel, Tim},
abstract={Recommendation systems are widely used on the Internet to assist customers in finding the products or services that best fit with their individual preferences. While current implementations successfully reduce information overload by generating personalized suggestions when searching for objects such as books or movies, recommendation systems so far cannot be found in another potential field of application: the personalized search for subjects such as applicants in a recruitment scenario. Theory shows that a good match between persons and jobs needs to consider both, the preferences of the recruiter and the preferences of the candidate. Based on this requirement for modeling bilateral selection decisions, we present an approach applying two distinct recommendation systems to the field in order to improve the match between people and jobs. Finally, we present first validation test runs from a student experiment showing promising results.},

abstract={Human resource management is the strategic approach to effectively managing people in a business or organization so that their business contributes to gaining competitive advantage. Many human resource management tasks are based on finding and matching individuals to positions. In this paper an ontology-based approach is presented for effectively matching job seekers and job positions over multiple criteria by making use of different skills ontologies, for discovering a set of profiles that best fits the job description criteria and ranking applicants. The general architecture of the framework is outlined and ontologies operations are described.},

title={Optimizing People Sourcing Through Semantic Matching of Job Description Documents and Candidate Profile Using Improved Topic Modelling Techniques},
author={Jain, Lorick and Vardhan, MA Harsha and Kathiresan, Ganesh and Narayan, Ananth},
abstract={People sourcing for a particular job role in any corporate venture is a painstaking, progress-impeding task, especially given the changing job market trends, quality of candidate profile and the sheer number of applicants. This paper elucidates an improvised topic modelling approach, where the semantic analysis stage is prepended with text summarization, for the procedure of people sourcing for job roles using topic modelling and machine learning techniques. The distinction between choosing the perfect candidate for the job and choosing a good candidate who is adept in certain domains but not relevant for the job and getting the candidate up to speed by providing on job training, and the downtime involved in the process is certainly a deciding factor in hiring a potential employee. The following paper aims to alleviate this issue by describing the algorithm which identifies the most suitable candidate in the applicants’ pool through a novel, robust approach which uses topic modelling techniques like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). It is empirically found that the precision of profile matching task was enhanced by using text summarization (through TextRank model) for both LSA and LDA by 21.4% and 50% respectively, and LSA outperforming LDA with regard to precision, in both with and without text summarization cases by 23.8% and 51.57%, respectively.},

author={Yasmin, Farzana and Nur, Mohammad Imtiaz and Arefin, Mohammad Shamsul},
abstract={Information extraction is a mechanism for devising an automatic method for text management. In the case of candidate recruitment, nowadays different companies ask the applicants to submit their applications or resumes in the form of electronic documents. In general, there are huge numbers of resumes dropped and therefore the volume of the documents increases. Extracting information and choosing the best candidates from all these documents manually are very difficult and time-consuming. In order to make the recruitment process easier for the companies, we have developed a framework that takes the resumes of candidates as well as the priorities of the employer as input, extract information of the candidates using Natural Language Processing (NLP) from the resumes, filter the candidates according to predefined rules and return the list of dominant candidates using skyline filtering.},

author={Nasr, Sara and German, Oleg},
abstract={Nowadays the number of people searching work is increasing and the number of university graduates is also getting larger. Companies searching for a perfect job candidate for a person working in the informatics domain may be lost between different resumes with different formats and big quantity. Selecting the best curriculum vitae (CV) is a considered a big step to help any company decide whether a job seeker is suitable or not. The criteria that should be taken into consideration is divided between a block of private information and another block of professional data. The blocks are based on age, education, participating in real projects, availability of published papers or research activities, possessing modern programming languages and technologies and so on. Selecting the perfect candidate needs an estimation based on a choice function similar to the utility function which weighs the different criteria and helps in evaluating them numerically. But since we may be dealing with some fuzzy or uncertain information we proposed the use of modified Boyer Moore algorithm and RELIEF method to reach the target.},

title={Screening the Candidates in IT Field Based on Semantic Web Technologies: Automatic Extraction of Technical Competencies from Unstructured Resumes.},
author={En{\u{a}}chescu, Mihaela-Irina},
abstract={While trying to fill in empty positions in a short time frame, struggling to find the best candidates while competing with other recruiters for them, nowadays, HR personnel need to consider innovative ways for reaching faster the IT professionals. Manually searching across professional networks is no longer an option. This study introduces the prototype of a system that automatically screens the candidates in the IT field. Its main goal is to provide a valuable support in the first stage of the personnel selection by decreasing the number of errors that can occur when thousands of CVs/profiles are manually filtered to pick candidates for an interview. Our proposed system consists in a mobile application that automatically selects online profiles from professional websites (like Indeed, LinkedIn, Monster) and ranks them, to finally display the eligible candidates for a particular open position to the recruiter. We developed an ontology to support the matching between the knowledge in the candidate’s resume and the requirements in the job description. While developing the ontology our primary focus was on the skills that are encompassed in a resume, as these are the key abilities when searching for the ideal candidate. The knowledge a job seeker should possess, respectively a job description requires, is divided in the following categories: programming languages, databases, frameworks, integrated development environments, methodologies and operating systems. First part of the implementation, automatically extracting the skills from unstructured resumes, was achieved using Apache Tika and GATE},

European and international public and private-sector developments for Skills Matching (in particular the matching of jobs and job seekers) and Skills Intelligence (labour market analyses and forecasts, in particular for political decision makers) are examined in an exemplary manner. We first provide an overview of the internationally most influential skills taxonomies and ontologies of the classical kind, which are created and curated by experts. These are contrasted with new, data-driven classifications. Subsequently, we describe the different areas of application of both classification types, followed by a wide variety of practical examples of initiatives, projects and products in the above-mentioned areas. The outlook section especially addresses the question of why and how, in addition to applicants and jobs, all types of educational programs should be annotated with skills taxonomies in the future.},

With services like job recommendations to students based on their skills, and candidate filtering to assist companies in candidate matching, the system is expected to be of use for both students for exploring jobs, and companies to find potential candidates suited for the job.},

title={The role of artificial intelligence in the recruitment and selection processes: a systematic review.},
author={Abou Hamdan, Lilian Fadi},
abstract={Artificial Intelligence’s (AI) scope has rapidly grown in the workplace, playing a strategic role in recruitment and selection by automating various tasks in the processes to identify and reach the talented, skilled and passive job seekers in less time and at a smaller cost, while excluding subjectivity and biases for efficient decision-making. Screening resumes automatically and matching a vacancy’s requirements to the applicant’s profile provided significant support in the screening phase, as it decreases the number of errors that may occur when thousands of resumes are manually filtered (Enachescu, 2016). Using AI, recruiters can rank the resumes based on skill and experience, get a deep insight into personality-related assets and better measure the applicant’s fit for the job, beyond the traditional resumes in order to successfully match them with available job openings, and avoid biased decisions (Dickson & Nusair, 2010). Therefore, the aim of our study is to scope out the existing literature around the topic while specifically examining the role of AI technological software in the recruitment and selection processes, hence providing the reader with a practical understanding of the future of human factor in the recruitment and selections processes.},

title={Towards an automated system for intelligent screening of candidates for recruitment using ontology mapping (EXPERT)},
author={Senthil Kumaran, V and Sankar, A},
abstract={Many e-recruitment tools for recruiting candidates for jobs have significantly spread in recent years. Companies often receive resumes from candidates using e-recruitment tools or via job portal for each job posting and manually short list qualified applicants. The existing e-recruitment tools have been mainly used for the storage of applicant contact data. In this paper, we present EXPERT, an intelligent tool for screening candidates for recruitment using ontology mapping. EXPERT has three phases in screening candidates for recruitment. In first phase, the system collects candidates’ resumes and constructs ontology document for the features of the candidates. Job openings/job requirements are represented as ontology in the second phase and in third phase, EXPERT maps the job requirement ontology onto the candidate ontology document and retrieves the eligible candidates. Experiment results show that this model improves the accuracy of matching candidates with job requirement.},

title={Web recommender system for job seeking and recruiting},
author={Tondji, Lionel Ngoupeyou},
abstract={In general, looking for a job while scanning a lists of hiring positions on recruitment sites, which really cost a lot of time and money is an annoying thing to do Althought most of the time those jobs are not always suitable with users, or users are not satisfied. By doing this, recruiters waste their time by making sure that they are qualified or not. This thesis seeks to address a very important issue in the recruitment process which is about matching jobs seekers with jobs offers. Nowadays, the matching process between the applicant and the job offers is one of the major problems companies have to handle. Shortlisting candidates and screening resumes are long time-consuming tasks for the company, especially when 80 percent to 90 percent of the resumes received for a role are unqualified. We have designed and proposed an hybrid personalized recommender system called skillake for job seeking and online recruiting websites adapted to the cold start problem using a clustering predictive algorithms. },
